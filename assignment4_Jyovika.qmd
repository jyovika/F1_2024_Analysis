## Data and Documenting

::: callout-info
**Main Question**

Do faster pitstops actually lead to better race results, or is it basically a non-factor?
:::

::: callout-info
**Sub-Questions**

1.  **How do we even define “faster”?**

    -   What’s the cutoff for a “quick” pitstop (e.g., top 10% of pit times)?

2.  **What’s the relationship between pitstop speed and final finish position??**

    -   Is there a clear pattern where drivers with lightning-fast stops consistently finish higher?

3.  **Is this “pit-speed → race outcome” thing consistent across seasons?**

    -   Did pit-crew wizardry matter more back in, say, 2010 than it does in 2024?

    -   Are teams converging on similar pit times now, making the gap less impactful?

**Why I chose this question**

1.  **Data-Driven Rigor** As a lifelong Formula 1 enthusiast, I’ve always been fascinated by the precision and strategy behind every race—and I finally have the tools to test my assumptions. Pit-stop durations and finishing positions are publicly available in CSVs and APIs, so rather than relying on anecdote or speculation, I can analyze hard numbers to determine whether quick pit stops truly influence race outcomes.

2.  **Illuminating an Underappreciated Factor** Everyone focuses on qualifying laps and engine performance, but pit-crew efficiency often feels like F1’s “secret sauce.” I’ve repeatedly wondered if those sub-23-second tire changes really move the needle on track position. By investigating this question, I hope to shed light on whether the hype around pit-crew speed is justified or if it’s overemphasized relative to other strategic elements.
