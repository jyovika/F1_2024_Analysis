## Data and Documenting

::: callout-info
**Main Question**

Do faster pitstops actually lead to better race results, or is it basically a non-factor?
:::

::: callout-info
**Sub-Questions**

1.  **How do we even define “faster”?**

    -   What’s the cutoff for a “quick” pitstop (e.g., top 10% of pit times)?

2.  **What’s the relationship between pitstop speed and final finish position??**

    -   Is there a clear pattern where drivers with lightning-fast stops consistently finish higher?

3.  **Is this “pit-speed → race outcome” thing consistent across seasons?**

    -   Did pit-crew wizardry matter more back in, say, 2010 than it does in 2024?

    -   Are teams converging on similar pit times now, making the gap less impactful?

**Why I chose this question**

1.  **Data-Driven Rigor** As a lifelong Formula 1 enthusiast, I’ve always been fascinated by the precision and strategy behind every race—and I finally have the tools to test my assumptions. Pit-stop durations and finishing positions are publicly available in CSVs and APIs, so rather than relying on anecdote or speculation, I can analyze hard numbers to determine whether quick pit stops truly influence race outcomes.

2.  **Illuminating an Underappreciated Factor** Everyone focuses on qualifying laps and engine performance, but pit-crew efficiency often feels like F1’s “secret sauce.” I’ve repeatedly wondered if those sub-23-second tire changes really move the needle on track position. By investigating this question, I hope to shed light on whether the hype around pit-crew speed is justified or if it’s overemphasized relative to other strategic elements.

## Behind the Scenes

#### 5. Tell us about parts of your data processing or analysis that weren’t “sexy” and wouldn’t typically be included in a blog post.

I started by trying to calculate the mean pit-stop time so I could include it in my “Why I Chose This Question” section, but I quickly realized this dataset is WILD. Most durations are in seconds.milliseconds, but because the data spans 2009–2024, some entries are in minutes:seconds.milliseconds—which completely threw off the mean. 

Next, I tried plotting a distribution to highlight the outliers (refer to Trial data.qmd on commit 3f3c5dd to see that plot), but the values ranged from 12.897 to 3069.017, so the plot wasn’t very useful either. In the end, I decided to report the median instead—it seemed like the smartest choice.

#### 6.  Were there any challenges that you faced in conducting this analysis.

I think the worst part of analyzing this data was figuring out how to use the API with JSON. Eventually, I gave up and luckily found CSV files that start from 2009.

The second worst part was figuring out how to put all my ggpairs graphs together because, at first, all the solutions I found were for ggplots. Apparently, ggplots and ggpairs have different classes, so those solutions weren’t working—until I finally found one lost-in-time post on Stack Overflow that used a solution someone shared on GitHub, which finally worked for me.

However, learning how to do correlation tests and visualize them was fairly simple in R, since I understood the fundamentals from my econometrics background.
#### 7.  Tell us about any imperfect parts of your work and how you would like to expand or improve this analysis in future?

#### 8. Also submit 4 earlier versions of your assignment that show your iterative process.
