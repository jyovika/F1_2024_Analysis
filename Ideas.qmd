##Question: How do average pit stop times compare across teams in a single season—and compare the constructors standing

Data :

Pit stop times endpoint (you can pull every pit stop for every race

Race results endpoint (to tie pit stops back to finishing positions)

mpact of Tyre Compound on Pit Stop Duration

##If you cluster drivers by # of stops + avg stop time, which strategy‐clusters gets the highest podium percentages?

Data sets:

pit_stops

race_results

##Pit-Stop Mastery: Who Gains Most from Strategy?

daata: pit_stops + lap_times + results + status

Idea: Examine whether faster pit stops (and timing under Safety Car vs. green flag) correlate with larger position gains on the out-lap—and how often those gains translate into podiums vs. retirements.
